maiddown.py is used to download the MAID2007 cross-sections, which is required
by the module. Please copy maiddown.py to your work dir and execute.

g12table.py is used to generate g1 and g2 tables to retrieve the polarized
radiative correction. It requires the g1 and g2 to have been calculated already
and saved in a pkl file. The script will read the pkl file and save the g1 and
g2 values to a text file.
